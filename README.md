MarioArtificialIntelligence
===========================

My Mario bot navigates through levels automatically. My solution utilized the A* algorithm and the simulation technique.

This is my senior project. I got the initiative to start this project thanks to Robin Baumgarten's YouTuve video. In my
solution, I took the same approach as Robin did, which was using the A* algorithm together with the simulation technique
I also reused his physics engine (LevelScene) to run simulation. Although I didn't contribute anything new to the 
solution, my biggest achievement were to fully understand how the simulation technique dramatically enhance the 
performance of A*. This led me to an important realization: AI is not just about an algorithm, it needs something else 
to complement the algorithm, such as the simulation technique in this case.

More in-depth discussion can be found on a ppt slide and a paper included.
